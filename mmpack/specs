      eegdev is a library that provides an interface for accessing various EEG
      (and other biosignals) acquisition systems in a unified way. The interface
      has been designed in order to be both flexible and efficient. The device
      specific part is implemented by the means of plugins which makes adding
      new device backend fairly easy even if the library does not support them
      yet officially.

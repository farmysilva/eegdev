The eegdev examples files are provided in 3 folders:


- library-usage
===============
	This contains examples of how to use the eegdev library into other
program, i.e. how to integrate the library into an acquisition loop. This
folder provides two examples: eegdev_acq, a simple acquisition loop, and
recinxdf, an example of how to integrate the acquisition and recording into
one independent module.


- plugin
===============
	This contains an example of implementation of a device backend. The
plugin, saw, implement a sawtooth function generator with a configurable
sampling rate.


- compat
===============
	This folder contains compatibility layer used by the plugin example.
They are not examples per se, but they are used by them and also provides a
example of how a good backend plugin should be written: targetting the POSIX
standard and providing replacement functions for the platforms that miss
some of the used POSIX functions. Although nothing here demonstrates how to
generate the config.h file, using autoconf or cmake will solve this problem 
easily.

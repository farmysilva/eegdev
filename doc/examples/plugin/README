                           eegdev plugin example
			            SAW


	This example implements a sawtooth function generator in NUM_EEG_CH
channels that provide Ã‹EG sensor types. The other channels provides trigger
channels. The sampling rate of the signal can be configured at runtime with
the "samplingrate" option.

	The dependency of the plugin is the pthread library (available in
all platform supported by eegdev, sometime through third party library)
like any eegdev plugin, as well as the library providing the POSIX function 
clock_gettime and clock_nanosleep. For the platforms that don't have them
(mainly MacOSX and Windows), replacement functions are provided in the 
compat folder of the eegdev examples.

	To test this plugin, you can use the examples provided in the
library-usage folder of eegdev examples. If you don't move the saw plugin
with the other installed eegdev plugins, make sure you execute the program
with EEGDEV_PLUGINS_DIR environment variable set in order that the eegdev
library find your compiled plugin (see egd_open manpage).

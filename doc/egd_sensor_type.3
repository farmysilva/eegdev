.SH NAME
egd_sensor_type, egd_sensor_name - Get the id or name of a sensor type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B #include <eegdev.h>
.sp
.BI "int egd_sensor_type(const char* " sname ");"
.br
.BI "const char* egd_sensor_name(int " stype ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBegd_sensor_type\fP() returns the identifier code of the sensor type named
\fIsname\fP. \fBegd_sensor_name\fP() is the reverse process: it retrieves
the name of the sensor type identified by \fIstype\fP.
.LP
Depending on which acquisition devices have been accessed by the library,
the sensor type identifier for a given name may be different from a previous
program execution. However once a association has been established it is
ensured that it will remain the same until the process termination.
Additionally, the sensor types named "\fBeeg\fP", "\fBtrigger\fP" and
"\fBundefined\fP" are always associated respectively to \fB0\fP, \fB1\fP and
\fB2\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.LP
In case of success, \fBegd_sensor_type\fP() returns a non negative value
corresponding to the identifier of the sensor type called \fIname\fP.
Otherwise it returns \-1.
.LP
In case of success, \fBegd_sensor_name\fP() returns
the name of the sensor type identified by \fIstype\fP. Otherwise, NULL is
returned and \fIerrno\fP is set accordingly.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
\fBegd_sensor_type\fP() or \fBegd_sensor_name\fP() will fail if:
.TP
.B EINVAL
\fIsname\fP is NULL or an empty string or if \fIstype\fP is
not a known sensor type identifier.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
\fIsname\fP was previously unknown but the system was unable to allocate
more memory to add the new entry to the table.
